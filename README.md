Searching, downloading and playing songs, now with 100% less annoying!

*This mod is a port of PC version of [BetterSongSearch](https://github.com/kinsi55/BeatSaber_BetterSongSearch) for Quest.*

## Features

- Wide variety of filtering / searching and sorting options
- Absolute banger of a UI that gives you as much information as possible at a single glance
- Preview of Songs that you havent downloaded yet ðŸ˜®
- Uses a locally cached database (Via SongDetailsCache) so all inputs are reflected instantly-ish at the cost of being unable to find songs which have been uploaded in the last couple of hours
- Accessible while in a Multiplayer lobby!
- Button to pick random songs based off your filter settings if you're trying to discover new stuff
- Download queue / history which is kept until the game is closed
- Songs can directly be played from the search, no need to manually look for them after downloading
- If downloads fail for some reason they are retried
